#This is a library used to do data processing for data mining
## In Data base tool, currently it only has a csv loader, which can be used to read csv file in to a given data base and table.
though most of the database(if not all) has a buildin function to load well formatted files(csv,xml) very fast. But for unstructure data, you definitly need to do it your self.
### the difference between data base tool and sqlarchemy is that, we try to make things simple if you know sql. No class for table.

## In data visualization, currently it only has a sample scirpt for two sided violine plot, multipul bar histogram. Later, I will add more script for data visulaization techniques that has no existed implementation in matplotlib

## In bug report minging, it includes some exited data mining techniques to detect duplicate bug reports and fault localization based on the similarity of bug reports.
